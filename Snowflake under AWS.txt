Is run with an EC2 (called a virtual warehouse in Snowflake)
virtual warehouse comes from say AWS

warehouses come in t-shirt sizes: s-mall to XXX-large
computing power roguhly double at every size level
and so does consuption increase and cost

Is used for
executing sql select statements
performing delete, insert, update

loading data into tables
copy into <table>

unloading data from tables
copy into <locations>

A simple create warehouse statement

create or replace warehouse my_wh

wharehouse_size = large;

additional settings
auto_suspend = 900
auto_resume = true
initially_suspended = false

min_cluster_count = 1
max_cluster_count = 10


In the web UI there's a menu called Virtual Warehouse
Create warehouse
alter warehouse
describe warehouse
drop warehouse
use warehouse
show warehouses


Each task or query is executed in a single virtual warehouse

Multiple virtual warehouses and/or user can simmultaneously 
read write and update data in the storage layer
conflicts are resolved by the transation manager in the cloud service


DDL	Structure	CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
DML	Data	    SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
DCL	Permissions	GRANT, REVOKE

Security Manager (IAM)
Snowflake can authenticate a user with the following:

SCIM (cross-domain identity mnagement). E.g. Azure AD
MFA (multi-factor)
Oauth (enables 3rd-party apps to authenticate user)
SSO (single sign-on)

Sql transactions in Snowflake can 
be done in blocks using begin to avoid conflicts 

Query optimized in Snowflake
manages metadata and micro partitions and distributes
query among warehouses to speed up processing
Reminder that data is stored in columnar format
