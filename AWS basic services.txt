VPC (virtual private cloud)
A virtual network you define in AWS
Provides network isolation and security
Like your office building/network layout
Defining IP ranges, subnets, firewalls (ACLs)
EC2, RDS, Lambda, EKS, etc.
It's free, you pay for data transfer

EC2 (elastic compute cloud) (aka VM - virtual machine)
It's launched within a VPC
You choose the OS (Linux/Windows), CPU, memory, and storage - 
then you launch your instance and connect via SSH or RDP. 
It’s super flexible and scalable.

Elastic Block Store (EBS)
A virtual hard drive that you can attach to a virtual machine.
SSD hard drives (attached to EC2 instances - virtual servers)
block-level storage service designed to work with EC2 (VM) instances
EBS can be backed-up to S3
EBS scaling is not fully auto-managed
It has an auto-scaling feature

S3 bucket (simple storage service)
-- remote folders to store data files
encrypted in transit and at rest for data protection

Amazon RDS (relational db service)
relational database services (in various flavors)
Sql server, to oracle, to MySql, to PostgreSql

DynamoDB (non-relational db)
schema-less
You can store documents with different structures in the same table.
Example of a DynamoDb db record (it's a json file or a dictionary type):
{
  "UserID": "12345",
  "Name": "John Doe",
  "Age": 30,
  "Address": {
    "Street": "123 Main St",
    "City": "Anytown",
    "PostalCode": "12345"
  },
  "Hobbies": ["Reading", "Traveling", "Sports"]
}

Amazon Redshift
Used for data warehousing (fast SQL based and great for BI)

Amazon Athena is an analytics tool that integrates wth S3
SQL style queries on all the content


Route 53 (dns domain name system)
aliases to URL's that make it easier to launch a site

CloudFront 
speeds up deivery of website content using cached copies

AWS Glue
serverless ETL

IAM (identity and access management)

AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning 
or managing servers. You just write your function, upload it, and AWS runs it only 
when triggered, automatically scaling as needed.

How Lambda works:
You write a function → upload to Lambda → trigger it via:
API call (via API Gateway)
File upload to S3
New record in DynamoDB
Scheduled event (like a cron job)

Lambda example:
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    print("New file uploaded to S3!")
    # download, resize, upload the thumbnail

Audit

AWS CloudWatch
app and infrastructure monitoring
checks how the whole ecosystem is doing (load, usage, space)
for monitoring and logging
Can be used to set alarms and send alert if some action is needed

EFS (elastic file system)
File storage (like a traditional file system)
fully managed, scalable file storage service 
shared file storage that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.
Performance Low-latency, file system performance (for file-level operations)
Access Control	File system permissions and POSIX access control

Storage gateway (if I want to move data from local env to the cloud
and want to keep a copy of the data locally)

Infrastructure security
